      <h2 class="h22">Why Choose Befriending Services?</h2>

      <p>
        Selecting a befriending service can be beneficial for various reasons, such as assistance with household chores or providing companionship, especially if your loved ones are not nearby. According to research conducted in UK "most older people in the UK are often lonely" and loneliness can put people at greater risk of poorer mental health, including depression. 
        <br><br>
        Certain factors can increase the risk of loneliness. These include personal characteristics like old age, disability, and circumstances like living alone, going through significant life changes, or living in certain areas. 
        <br><br> 
        So, maintaining social connections is crucial for mental well-being. Whether it's a conversation with loved one, a home visit, or engaging in community activities, keeping your mind active should be a top priority. This is one of the reasons why Exodus Companions provide befriending services, to address these problems.
